# [0x09. Python - Everything is object]()

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone:

    Why Python programming is awesome
    What is an object
    What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
    What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object
    What is a reference
    What is an assignment
    What is an alias
    How to know if two variables are identical
    How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
    How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
    What is mutable and immutable
    What are the built-in mutable types
    What are the built-in immutable types
    How does Python pass variables to functions

## Mandatory Tasks

### 0. [Who am I?]()

        What function would you use to print the type of an object?

        Write the name of the function in the file, without ().

### 1. [Where are you?]()

        How do you get the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)?

        Write the name of the function in the file, without ().

### 2. [Right count]()

        In the following code, do a and b point to the same object? Answer with Yes or No.

        >>> a = 89
        >>> b = 100

### 3. [Right count=]()

        In the following code, do a and b point to the same object? Answer with Yes or No.

        >>> a = 89
        >>> b = 89

### 4. [Right count=]()

        In the following code, do a and b point to the same object? Answer with Yes or No.

        >>> a = 89
        >>> b = a

### 5. [Right count=+]()

        In the following code, do a and b point to the same object? Answer with Yes or No.

        >>> a = 89
        >>> b = a + 1

### 6. [Is equal]()

        What do these 3 lines print?

        >>> s1 = "Best School"
        >>> s2 = s1
        >>> print(s1 == s2)

### 7. [Is the same]()

        What do these 3 lines print?

        >>> s1 = "Best"
        >>> s2 = s1
        >>> print(s1 is s2)

### 8. [Is really equal]()

        What do these 3 lines print?

        >>> s1 = "Best School"
        >>> s2 = "Best School"
        >>> print(s1 == s2)

### 9. [Is really the same]()

        What do these 3 lines print?

        >>> s1 = "Best School"
        >>> s2 = "Best School"
        >>> print(s1 is s2)

### 10. [And with a list, is it equal]()

        What do these 3 lines print?

        >>> l1 = [1, 2, 3]
        >>> l2 = [1, 2, 3] 
        >>> print(l1 == l2)

### 11. [And with a list, is it the same]()

        What do these 3 lines print?

        >>> l1 = [1, 2, 3]
        >>> l2 = [1, 2, 3] 
        >>> print(l1 is l2)

### 12. [And with a list, is it really equal]()

        What do these 3 lines print?

        >>> l1 = [1, 2, 3]
        >>> l2 = [1, 2, 3] 
        >>> print(l1 == l2)

### 13. [And with a list, is it really the same]()

        What do these 3 lines print?

        >>> l1 = [1, 2, 3]
        >>> l2 = l1 
        >>> print(l1 is l2)

### 14. [List append]()

        What does this script print?

        l1 = [1, 2, 3]
        l2 = l1
        l1.append(4)
        print(l2)
